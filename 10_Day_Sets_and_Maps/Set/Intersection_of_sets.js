//Intersection of sets
// To find an intersection of two sets can be achieved using filter. Lets find the intersection of set A and set B (A ∩ B)
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let b = [3, 4, 5, 6];

let A = new Set(a);
let B = new Set(b);
let c = a.filter((num) => B.has(num));
let C = new Set(c);
console.log(C);
