// As we have seen in the earlier section, we can split a string at different positions, and we can change to an array. Let us see the examples below.
let programing_languge = "javaScript";
const characters = programing_languge.split("");
console.log(characters);
//////using words
let companiesString = "Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle, Amazon";
const companies = companiesString.split(",");
console.log(companies);
